## Reloaded

Use this tutorial:
https://rlog.rgtti.com/2014/05/01/how-to-modify-a-keyboard-layout-in-linux/

I created a variant at the end of us symbol file with the data
```
partial alphanumeric_keys
xkb_symbols "standard-quotes"  {

    include "us(intl)"

    key <AC11> { [ apostrophe,   quotedbl,   dead_acute, dead_diaeresis   ] };
};
```

then, followed the tutorial editing the four .lst and .xml files.
Then modified sway config to use the variant i wanted (standard-quotes), and then it's okay now.
